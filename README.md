#TrainerX
TrainerX its a GTA:SA / SA:MP cheat created for study proposes, with this trainer you can set the player health, armor and money.

####Which type of cheat it has?
For now there are only 3 types of cheats `Health,Armor and Money`, but I will add more in the future you can do the same if you wan't to.

####How to use it
After you compiled it you will need to open the GTA and then the program.
If your antivirus acuse's your program has a virus don't panic. 

####Add more functions
If you want to add more functions to the Trainer you can add the address in the enumeration, e.g: `TRAINER_DEAGLE` but make sure that the address isn't dynamic. If the address is dynamic you can use the method that I created but it isn't the best method so try to do by yourself and if you want you can pull a request.

####How did you get the address's?
To get the address's you can use Cheat Engine but if you are to lazy you can check [this list of Memory Address](http://www.gtamodding.com/?title=Memory_Addresses_(SA) ) it has all the GTA SA address's, but be careful you may crash the game so make sure you are using the right address.

####Can I Contribute?
Yes you can, just fork and pull a request, you're welcome.
